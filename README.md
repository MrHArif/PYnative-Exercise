Variables
INT
Any whole number is an integer. For example, the value 1 is a whole number, 
so it’s an integer. On the other hand, 1.0 isn’t a whole number; it has a decimal part to it, so it’s not an integer. Integers are represented by the int
data type.
As with storage boxes, variables have capacity limits. Trying to stuff a 
value that’s too large into a storage box results in an error. On most platforms, you can store numbers between –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 
9,223,372,036,854,775,807 within an int (which is the maximum value that 
fits in a 64-bit variable). Even though that’s a really large number, it isn’t 
infinite.
FLOATING-POINT
Any number that includes a decimal portion is a floating-point value. For 
example, 1.0 has a decimal part, so it’s a floating-point value. Many people get 
confused about whole numbers and floating-point numbers, but the difference 
is easy to remember. If you see a decimal in the number, then it’s a floatingpoint value. Python stores floating-point values in the float data type.
Floating-point values have an advantage over integer values in that you can
store immensely large or incredibly small values in them. As with integer variables, floating-point variables have a storage capacity. In their case, the maximum value that a variable can contain is ±1.7976931348623157 × 10308 and the 
minimum value that a variable can contain is ±2.2250738585072014 × 10-308 on 
most platforms
